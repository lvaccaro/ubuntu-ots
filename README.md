# Timestamping the Ubuntu packages

The OpenTimestamps team has timestamped every package in the Ubuntu repositories
and made those timestamps publically available via a [searchable
database](https://opentimestamps.org/ubuntu/).


### Run the Application

We have preconfigured the project with a simple development web server. The simplest way to start
this server is:

```
npm start
```

Now browse to the app at [`localhost:8000/index.html`][local-app-url].
